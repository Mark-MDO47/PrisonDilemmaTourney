# MISTAKE_PERCENTAGES_LIST is a list of the fraction of choices made that will not be performed correctly.
#    For instance, a DEFECT might turn into a COOPERATE or vice versa
# This is the percentage chance for EACH move by each player; this makes things more sensitive than
#    what is reported in the literature. It is not exactly clear to me what their percentages mean.

# The REWARDS_DICT gives a range of rewards to cycle through.
# The order of rewards (lengths of prison sentences) is:
#    [S,R,P,T] or alternatively [D_C, C_C, D_D, C_D]
# The general rule for sentences for being in a "prisoner's dilemma" contest is T > R > P > S
#    Some feel there is another rule that T + S > 2R
